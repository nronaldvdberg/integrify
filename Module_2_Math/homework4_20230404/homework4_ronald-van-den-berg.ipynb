    "<font color='blue'><b>Long answer</b><br>\n",
    "<font color='blue'>While most scientists use .05 is a rejection level, this is not a golden rule and it lacks theoretical justification. Even Ronald Fisher himself (the father of the $p$-value and the first person to propose $\\alpha = .05$ as a suitable rejection level) thought it would be absurd to use the same rejection level in every situation:<br><br>\n",
    "<i>\"A man who ‘rejects’ a hypothesis provisionally, as a matter of habitual practice, when the significance is at the 1% level or higher, will certainly be mistaken in not more than 1% of such decisions. For when the hypothesis is correct he will be mistaken in just 1% of these cases, and when it is incorrect he will never be mistaken in rejection. [...] However, the calculation is absurdly academic, **for in fact no scientific worker has a fixed level of significance at which from year to year, and in all circumstances, he rejects hypotheses; he rather gives his mind to each particular case in the light of his evidence and his ideas.** It should not be forgotten that the cases chosen for applying a test are manifestly a highly selected set, and that the conditions of selection cannot be specified even for a single worker; nor that in the argument used it would clearly be illegitimate for one to choose the actual level of significance indicated by a particular trial as though it were his lifelong habit to use just this level.\"</i>\n",
    "<br>(Statistical Methods and Scientific Inference, 1956, p. 42-45)<br><br>\n",
    "In practice, what is a suitable rejection level depends on many factors, including the cost of making certain types of decision errors. For example, if it is very costly to wrongfully reject a true H0, then we may want to be conservative and choose a very low alpha level. If it is very costly to fail to reject a false H0, then we may want to be liberal and use a relatively high alpha level.\n",

    "<font color='blue'><i>Does the mean of this sample deviate by more than 1.96 standard deviations from the hypothesized population mean?</i><br><br>To answer this, we need to know the distribution of the sample mean. It can be shown that the sampling mean follows a normal distribution itself (CLT). Assuming that the standard deviation of the population is $\\sigma=2$, the standard deviation of that distribution is $\\hat{\\sigma}_{pop} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$. In the present case, we find $\\hat{\\sigma} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{50}} = 0.283$. The z-value thus equals $\\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{179.84 - 180.00}{0.283} = -0.57$. This is well within the critical values of -1.96 and 1.96, which means that the current data do not give us a reason to reject the hypothesis that they come from a population with a mean equal to 180 cm.</font>\n"
