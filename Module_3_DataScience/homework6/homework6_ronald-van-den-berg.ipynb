    "    - a. Each group member will be working on one country (Finland, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, and Germany)\n",

    "    - e. The keys in the sub-dictionaries correspond to keywords, and the values correspond to the company’s posts that include those keywords. \n",

    "Next time you run this course you might want to inform students about the risk of getting blacklisted by their most important job seeking resource *before* you have them do the assignment :) Or, even better, don't use LinkedIn for scraping exercises (instead use e.g. an American job board)"
