    "# 6.3 Nasa Satellite images - solution 2 (without selenium; faster)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Suppose we want to build a Computer vision dataset that involves satellite images. \n",
    "2. Your tasks are the following:\n",
    "    * Collect satellite images from  https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images\n",
    "    * Make sure to render the whole page using selenium and then use BeautifulSoup to scrape the data.\n",
    "    * Create a repo and name it Images, Save the crowled images based on their titles. \n",
    "    * Create a dictionary where the keys are the images/titles and the values are the imagesâ€™ descriptions.\n"
