    "This database, updated daily, contains ads that ran on Facebook and were submitted by thousands of ProPublica users from around the world. We asked our readers to install browser extensions that automatically collected advertisements on their Facebook pages and sent them to our servers. We then used a machine learning classifier to identify which ads were likely political and included them in this dataset."
